Programming Languages Assignment 4

The family tree is that of William Shakespeare. Starting with his parents and going down
to his grandchildren meaning it spans 4 different generations and contains more than 15 people.
NOTE that there is Thomas Quiney and Thomas II Quiney. The names all include last names 
women who were married maintain their maiden names in the database to show who married 
into the family. 

Prolog
Run it just like we did in class. Use ancestor_of the same way you might for gp_of.

Python
Run the program using python 3.7 either with interpretive mode or just regular running
of a file. If you run the file it will print all the example cases of each of the queries.
If you do interpretted, you can do you own queries.

BE SURE TO SPELL THINGS RIGHT AND INCLUDE LASTNAMES.
